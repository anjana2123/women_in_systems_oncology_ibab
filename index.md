## Day 1

### Lec 1: Using Artificial Intelligence for Cancer Screening
**Geetha Manjunath**  
*CEO and Founder-Niramai Health Analytix, Bangalore*  
Breast cancer is the largest cause of cancer deaths in women. Thermalytix is a novel breast cancer screening test using Artificial intelligence algorithms over thermal scans to detect early stage breast malignancies. The test is radiation free, non-invasive, affordable, portable, privacy aware and more sensitive than mammography for women of all ages. In this talk, the speaker will share the key details of AI algorithms that have made cancer detection possible and challenges faced in taking an idea to become a cancer screening product.

### Lec 2: Alternative Splicing in Genes of the Sphingolipid Pathway: An Evolving Paradigm in Cancer
**Ujjaini Dasgupta**  
*Amity Institute of Integrative Sciences and Health, Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Manesar*  
Global dysregulation of splicing has emerged as a vital player in cancer. Alternative Splicing (AS) regulates all cancer phenotypes like proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis multidrug resistance, angiogenesis, and metabolism that collaboratively lead to tumor progression. In recent years, sphingolipids have emerged as crucial regulators of cancer progression, and response to the anticancer treatments. The role of AS in regulating the expression of genes in the sphingolipid pathway is, however, still unexplored. Therefore, we identified AS events like cassette exon (CE) and intron retention (IR) in sphingolipid genes leading to differential transcript isoform abundance and dysregulation in sphingolipids that contribute significantly to cancer phenotypes. We also aimed to decipher the impact of chemotherapy on sphingolipid metabolism through AS-mediated gene regulation. Bioinformatic analysis of TCGA BRCA datasets identified breast cancer subtype-specific AS events and a splicing signature of sphingolipid genes in normal-like versus various breast cancer subtypes. From these signatures, we identified a unique CE event in Ceramide Synthase 2 (CERS2) specific for the Luminal B subtype and another in UDP-glucose Ceramide Glucosyl transferase (UGCG) that we characterized to elucidate how they regulate phenotypes like cell proliferation and migration. I will also show how chemotherapeutic regimens modulate the level of ceramides and glucosylceramides (responsible for apoptotic cell death and drug resistance) through AS of sphingolipid genes. My talk will highlight the importance of AS in sphingolipid metabolism that impacts cancer progression.

### Lec 3: Deciphering Epigenetic Reprogramming in p53 Deficient/Mutant Colorectal Cancer
**Vijayalakshmi Mahadevan**  
*Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB), Bangalore*  
Alterations in epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure are known to drive tumour initiation and progression. Colorectal cancer (CRC) shows 40-50% mutations in tumor suppressor p53 leading to higher metastatic potential and drug resistance. The clinical importance of p53 mutations in colorectal cancer emphasizes the need to understand the interplay between p53 signalling and epigenetic regulation in colon cancer. Towards this, we investigated the genome-wide enrichment profiles of several epigenetic marks using ChIP sequencing. Our genome-wide profiling of the enhancer mark H3K27 ac in p53 null CRC cells reveals an overall increase in sites that are occupied by H3K27 ac upon p53 loss and a greater occupancy at the promoters than at the distal intergenic regions. Active enhancers showed strong association with oncogenes and hallmark MYC targets suggesting an enhancer-mediated reprogramming of MYC pathway upon p53 loss. The loss of p53 was also accompanied by gain of super enhancers which functionally correlated with oncogenic expression. The genes associated with super enhancers were found to correlate with CMS4 subtype of colorectal cancer with low survival rates as observed in the TCGA-COAD cohort. These observations suggest an enhancer/super enhancer driven stemness and mesenchymal state in CRCs with the loss of p53. We also investigated the influence of p53 on TGFÃŸ induced epigenetic alterations on 4 different CRC cell lines with varying status of p53. Our observations on agonist and antagonistic relationships between EMT factors SNAI1 and SNAI2 with epigenetic enzymes KDM6/6B and the chromatin organizer SATB1 in p53 null CRC cells suggest a crosstalk between epigenetic and EMT factors. These approaches are poised to yield drug targets that can be targeted for epigenetic therapy in p53 mutant patients.

### Lec 4: [10x Genomics Presentation]

### Lec 5: Navigating Breast Cancer in Indian Women - Insights from Longitudinal Study
**Jyoti Prabhu**  
*St. John's Research Institute, Bangalore*  
The incidence of breast cancer is steadily increasing in India, particularly among younger women and in urban centres. Our longitudinal studies and long-term follow-up have documented clinical presentation patterns and disease outcomes following standard treatments. This talk presented insights from molecular analyses, focusing on young premenopausal women and the unique tumour microenvironment in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer subtypes.

### Lec 6: Does Every Breast Cancer Patient Need Chemotherapy? Role of "Made in India" Innovative Tests in Decision Making
**Dr. Manjiri Bakre**  
*CEO - OncoStem Diagnostics Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore*  
As you may know, close to 2 lakh breast cancer patients are diagnosed every year in India and it is also the biggest cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Today about 95% of breast cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy, but a vast majority (~70%) of early stage (Stage I/II) breast cancer patients do not benefit from chemotherapy. The side effects of chemotherapy are very painful for the patient and bring down quality of life tremendously besides being a monetary drain. This devastating fact motivated us to develop India's first AI-based flagship prognostic test "CanAssist Breast" which helps clinicians to understand which patient needs/benefits from chemotherapy versus not. This in turn helps clinicians to plan a personalized treatment with patients with or without chemotherapy. OncoStem Diagnostics is a Med Tech start-up based out of Bangalore. In my talk, I will discuss briefly about CanAssist Breast and showcase how an Indian start-up company can make a difference in the lives of our patients.

### Lec 7: Integrating Ayurveda in Cancer Treatment: Initiating Molecular Dialogues through Ayurgenomics
**Mitali Mukerji**  
*Department of Bioscience & Bioengineering, School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AIDE), Indian Institute of Technology - Jodhpur*  
We are currently witnessing a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, transitioning from a reactive stance to a more proactive, holistic, and precise approach. This approach resonates with the principles of Ayurveda, practiced in India for thousands of years. However, the decision to opt for Ayurveda as an additional medical option often rests with patients who possess limited understanding and evidence. One of the challenges lies in the limited communication between Ayurveda and modern medicine practitioners. Integrative medicine aims to provide informed choices for cancer management, drawing from multiple systems of medicine. However, the existing gap necessitates the development of comprehensive frameworks that facilitate communication between these disciplines and offer evidence-based solutions grounded in the principles and applications of traditional medicines. The science of Ayurgenomics has initiated molecular dialogues between these streams. Ayurgenomics provides an operational framework to (a) bridge the ontologies of Ayurveda and modern medicine through genomics approaches, (b) identify biomarkers for early actionable interventions and risk stratification, (c) comprehend genetic individuality influencing variable drug and environmental responses from a systems perspective, and (d) elucidate the mechanisms underlying Ayurveda-specific interventions and explore repurposing possibilities. These can also be extended to offer evidence-based solutions for other traditional medicine practices, including yoga and meditation. At the Ayurtech Centre of Excellence, we are integrating different disciplines of engineering sciences to bridge the gap between traditional and modern healthcare with a holistic approach. This approach not only provides a win-win situation but also enables the development of rigorous standards for the evidence-based practice of traditional medicine. The key benefits of integrative medicine will be discussed in the context of personalized cancer care in this presentation.
